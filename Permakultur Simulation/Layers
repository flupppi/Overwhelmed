Layers are a tool used to design sustainable ecosystems that directly benefit humans.
A mature ecosystem has many relationships between its constituent parts such as trees, understory, ground cover, soil, fungi, insects, and animals.
Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of organisms can occupy a relatively small space, each at a different layer.
Forests offer seven basic layers, although there can be many more, such as fungi.

Rhizosphere: 
Root layers within the soil. The major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots and zomes (including root crops such as potatoes and other edible tubers), fungi, insects, nematodes, worms, etc.

Soil surface/groundcover: 
Overlaps with the herbaceous layer and the groundcover layer; however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground, densely fill bare patches, and typically can tolerate some foot traffic. Cover crops retain soil and lessen erosion, along with green manures that add nutrients and organic matter, especially nitrogen.

Herbaceous layer: 
Plants that die back to the ground every winter, if cold enough. No woody stems. Many beneficial plants such as culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer. Annuals, biennials and perennials.

Shrub layer: 
woody perennials of limited height. Includes most berry bushes.

Understory layer: 
trees that flourish under the canopy.

The canopy: 
the tallest trees. Large trees dominate, but typically do not saturate the area, i.e., some patches are devoid of trees.

Vertical layer: 
climbers or vines, such as runner beans and lima beans (vine varieties).
