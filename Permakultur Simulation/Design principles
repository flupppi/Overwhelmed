Observe and interact:
Take time to engage with nature to design solutions that suit a particular situation.

Catch and store energy:
Develop systems that collect resources at peak abundance for use in times of need.

Obtain a yield:
Emphasize projects that generate meaningful rewards.

Apply self-regulation and accept feedback:
Discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems function well.

Use and value renewable resources and services:
Make the best use of nature's abundance: reduce consumption and dependence on non-renewable resources.

Produce no waste:
Value and employ all available resources: waste nothing.

Design from patterns to details:
Observe patterns in nature and society and use them to inform designs, later adding details.

Integrate rather than segregate:
Proper designs allow relationships to develop between design elements, allowing them to work together to support each other.

Use small and slow solutions:
Small and slow systems are easier to maintain, make better use of local resources, and produce more sustainable outcomes.

Use and value diversity:
Diversity reduces system-level vulnerability to threats and fully exploits its environment.

Use edges and value the marginal:
The border between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the system's most valuable, diverse, and productive elements.

Creatively use and respond to change:
A positive impact on inevitable change comes from careful observation, followed by well-timed intervention.
