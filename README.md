# Overwhelmed
> Something overwhelming is very intense and hard to deal with: overwhelming events make people worried and stressed out. It's hard to overcome overwhelming things. If you feel an overwhelming need to laugh, you're probably going to laugh. If you have an overwhelming feeling of sadness, you'll probably cry.

Overwhelm can be one of the best or worst experiences we can have. Our lives are sometimes overwhelming in a negative way, while a positive emotional overwhelm of joy can be a great balancing Factor. There is also a physical overwelm by the force of Nature.

The Goal is to build Games, a overwhelming and complex problem. But with the potential of bringing overwhelming fun and adressing overwhelming topics.
