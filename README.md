# Overwhelmed
> Something overwhelming is very intense and hard to deal with: overwhelming events make people worried and stressed out. It's hard to overcome overwhelming things. If you feel an overwhelming need to laugh, you're probably going to laugh. If you have an overwhelming feeling of sadness, you'll probably cry.

Overwhelm can be one of the best or worst experiences we can have. Our lives are sometimes overwhelming in a negative way, while a positive emotional overwhelm of joy can be a great balancing Factor. There is also a physical overwelm by the force of Nature.

The Goal is to build Games, a overwhelming and complex problem. But with the potential of bringing overwhelming fun and adressing overwhelming topics.

OVERWHELMED for me is a general feeling I constantly have and a permanent project, where i try to think of ways to incorperate my three biggest value into something that can provide me with a sense of accomplishment and benefit the world.

1.  Regenerating the Environment
This aspect is about not stopping to search for a better thing to put your time into until you find someting that is environmentally sustainable, or even better, regenerating the environment as you do it. I could have decided on a lot of jobs until now, but by waiting and putting a lot of effort into thinking abour how i can incorperate this belief without throwing everything over board has been very challenging, but now that I think that i have found something it really pays off.
 
2.  Free and Open Source Software
For me this is mostly about peace of mind. When i switched away from Windows, it was a pretty hard transformation and this initial moment of loosing everything that I had built on this platform and all the licenses was devestating. What i gained was freedom of using and participating in software I love.
There is just a different Wind blowing in the open source sphere. This collaboration focused and welcoming environment, where everyone is welcome to take a piece of software and alter it in a way to that it fits their own purpose is really special. 
It often kind of sets the technological development back a few years of time, but since there is nothing that you can't get this is fine and you don't realize most of it after some time.
Thinking of raising a business under open source licenses is a whole other thing. It is a combination of personal values and hard reality of life that challenges our thinking and is not easy to explain. I think what is clear from the get go is the improved availability and fairness since everyone who has access to basic computational hardware can use whatever gets published. This combined with different revenue flows gets us a stable business model that also improves participation and creates a market effect.

3.  People Care
All the energy you put into the Environment and Open Source software is worth nothing if you or someone in your closer environemt gets unhappy from what you are doing. Being able to care for your close surroundings is a central element. That also means having a system that intrinsically surrounds you with these people. Further your job has to leave you width enough time to get into caring for the people. Having a functioning social structure then opens the possibility of you succeeding at the first two goals. Not having it prevents the first two.

The whole thing is called OVERWHELMED because this task is huge. Life is difficult as it is but wanting to achieve these goals is even a step further.
# Permaculture App – Working Title

This is a long-term, modular, open-source project to create interactive tools for observation, simulation, and design based on permaculture principles. It combines spatial awareness, environmental sensing, and user-guided planning to support real-world decision making—starting in small, indoor spaces and growing outward.

## Why This Exists

Years ago, I had a vision of software that helps us care for the world by learning from it. I’ve studied, worked, wandered, and come back. This repo is my way of reconnecting with that vision and moving forward—one commit at a time.

## Status

This is the beginning. Ideas are being collected and sorted. Some parts may already exist in the world. This is still worth building.

## Structure

- `/docs/` – Concept sketches, old notes, scanned posters, research
- `/ideas/` – Modular threads for features, thoughts, and experiments
- `/experiments/` – Game jam projects, isolated tests
- `/app/` – Future home of real code
- `/assets/` – Screenshots, diagrams, visuals
